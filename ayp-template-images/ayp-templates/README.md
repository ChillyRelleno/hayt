'ayp_strip_template.png' is the same dimensions as existing strip backgrounds.  Place your photos behind the framework or in the panels.

For proper attribution please name your background "$handle_background-name.extension," ex. "Muta_work_sando.jpg"

'avatarget.png' is the exact width and rough height of the avatar boxes; scale your avatar into this file and save it as the lowercase form of the desired handle - 'Muta_work' would be 'muta_work.png'.  If it floats, awesome.  If it doesn't float, make sure the feet or neck or whatever touch the bottom of the frame.
